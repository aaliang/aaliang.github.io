            <p>Next week I am returning to industry. It's been just under eight months since I've pulled in a steady paycheck and I'm just about ready to go back. Looking back at my break I still think it was the right decision. At the very least I've gained two life skills: how to properly use a french press (I'm a sorry excuse for a human adult) and how to ride a motorbike. I'm extremely fortunate to have been able to afford pushing the eject button. In today's world of over-sharing it's easy to get swayed by what your peers are doing - maybe they're buying houses, getting married, pursuing advanced degrees, etc. These are all awesome things for the right people and great things to live for.</p>

<p>To be honest, leaving a career  in pursuit of self-improvement is really not a grandiose thing to do. In fact it's absolutely selfish. Few people have the means or support system to eschew adult responsibilities for extended periods of time. When I left [the only home I've ever known] last summer I didn't have a concrete goal, yes I had abstract thoughts about what I wanted to do but I wouldn't have been able to describe what my endgame was. I really only had two (and a half) things to cross off my bucket list which was:</p>

<ul>
<li>go backpacking in Southeast Asia</li>
<li>go to the Recurse Center in New York City</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm extremely privileged to have been able to do this. To many people when they start their first job they'll have to keep working until they're forced to retire. Often times people hate the situation they're in but stick it out because their alternative prospects aren't as great. Other people eventually convince themselves to like it because they have to keep up an image or lifestyle.</p>

<p>Cards on the table: finding a good job after taking a hiatus from tech wasn't exactly a walk in the park. I walked away from a lot of interviews thinking they were slam dunks only to get a <strong>thanks for interviewing with us, but we don't want you</strong>-type response (there have been many of these). I don't have any insightful advice on this front aside. Just keep your head up - treat every time that you feel unwanted as another chip on your shoulder. For everyone who says you're not good enough, use this as a chance to prove to yourself that you are.</p>

<p>It took me longer than expected to put ink on paper for the right opportunity. Come next Monday I'll be starting in Union Square NYC leading the next generation of backend development on <a href="http://indicative.com">Indicative's</a> behavioral analytics platform.</p>
