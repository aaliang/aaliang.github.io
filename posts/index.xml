      <description>Part of the reason I&amp;rsquo;m in this part of the world right now is because of a joke, and admittedly it&amp;rsquo;s barely a joke. I went on a bender (of sorts) for music last September. I had select songs from the Spotify Soul Playlist saved on my phone, a disproportionate amount of which happened to feature a certain US state in their lyrics. Fast forward to the middle of October, and I suddenly found myself with two weeks off before starting a new job&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s not much more I can say about this. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I knew Vanessa well but we were in the same year at BU, former WordStream, and eventual NYC transplants. When I read the news yesterday, I was left with an odd sense of profound sadness. The details have yet to emerge but this is nothing short of a tragedy. I&amp;rsquo;ve always understood that the world was unfair, that good and bad things can happen outside of our realm of control.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been an incredible journey over the last month. Somewhere over either Vietnam or the South China Sea I was ambushed with the irony of flying halfway around the world just to move again a few days later. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t, and still can&amp;rsquo;t believe that this is finally happening.
The sweltering heat is only one of the things you leave behind when traveling roughly 14,000 kilometers from Bangkok to Boston. After a couple days you learn to appreciate any air-conditioned havens you discover.</description>

      <title>The Only Risk Is That You Go Insane</title>

      <description>I landed in this country 6 days ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve traversed nearly 1,000 kilometers in that span via taxi, pickup truck, ferry, train, subway, mini-van, motorbike, and of course my legs. Just 8 days ago I was still a full-time employee at redacted. 1
It was drizzling when I deplaned at Bangkok&amp;rsquo;s Suvarnabhumi Airport; this came as no surprise as it rains briefly almost every day in mainland SEA&amp;rsquo;s wet season (typically between June - October).</description>
