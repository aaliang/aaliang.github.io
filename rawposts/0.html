This will be a representation of whatever is in my head at time of writing in an honest form. I can't promise that whatever I'm writing about will make sense, I can't even promise that I truly believe what I'm writing down. Thoughts and beliefs are ephemeral after all, typesetted characters are not. My other <a href="/">posts</a> are more content-full [contrived] and are about <i>subjects</i>. These are just thoughts and words for the most part unedited.

This is an exercise. There's this thing called <a href="http://750words.com">750words.com</a>. I've started writing 750 words each day there, privately. This is a continuation of those 750 words. Some differences however: 1) I'm not going to promise a post per 24 hours. 2) I'm going to always write my 750 words a day before these. 3) I'm not keeping myself to the 750 word minimum here. and 4) people can actually read these. These words aren't inherently meant to be public, rather they exist in a public medium. I will never promote any posts in here. And if you ask me about them, I'm not sure if I will acknowledge their existence (this isn't to discourage trying).
