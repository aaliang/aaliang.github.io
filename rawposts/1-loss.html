<p>There's not much more I can say about this. I can't say that I knew Vanessa well but we were in the same year at BU, former WordStream, and eventual NYC transplants. When I read the news yesterday, I was left with an odd sense of profound sadness.The details have yet to emerge but this is nothing short of a tragedy. I've always understood that the world was unfair, that good and bad things can happen outside of our realm of control.</p>
<p>Yet I always believed that we should still be good to one another, and especially to strangers, no matter what. Even after coming to NYC, I've been able to surround myself in a similar insular, presumably safe neighborhood but what does that even mean anymore? I don't know what to believe.</p>
<p>Looking back at the naive boy who left New England last summer, he just seems too vulnerable to have survived.</p>
